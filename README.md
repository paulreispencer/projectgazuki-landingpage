# Project Gazuki Landing Page
This landing page is about a fictional-crafted brand that my groupmates and I worked on, they focused on things like making the logo while I code the frontend consistently for approximately three weeks.

## Features
The landing page consists of three gimmicks to capture the attention of the audience:
- Scroll-based animation.
- Image carousel.
- Transitions of texts.

## What I learned
The mentioned gimmicks were part of the rubrics, which helped me to productively learn something new in JavaScript and CSS.
- Eventlisteners (JS)
- Arrow functions (JS)
- Animation Timeline (CSS)
- Superficially DOM Manipulation (JS)

## Conclusion
